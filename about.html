          <br>
          <p>
            With nearly three decades of law-enforcement experience in an extremely active, mid-size, Bay Area agency, I recognized the need for an up-fitter who had the ability to find creative solutions for our law enforcement fleet. A fleet that ranged from marked and unmarked vehicles, to undercover and specialized clandestine vehicles.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Working with a former prosecutor, Kevin Kress, we opened TK2 Outfitters, LLC, in 2022 to address these needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consisting of a small team of highly skilled technicians, fabricators and specialists; attention to detail, craftsmanship and highly responsive service is what sets us apart from the competition. We understand how critical it is to create a safe, reliable, and high functioning operational environment so first responders can simply focus on their mission.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            In addition to our outfitting services, we also provide fleet management services to include auditing, recommendations, procurement and status management. Managers of small to mid-sized agencies often shoulder the burden of juggling an excess of ancillary responsibilities. This often results in a less than optimal allocation of time and resources. TK2 Outfitters can help alleviate some of that burden and create a more efficient work flow for your staff so they can focus on other important leadership duties.
          </p>
          <br>

          <p>
            We look forward to helping your agency maintain a mission ready fleet and provide your first responders with the most reliable, effective, and intuitive emergency and/or specialty vehicle systems possible. TK2 was created by a retired police captain and a former criminal prosecutor who saw the need to bring fleet solutions to San Francisco's North Bay.
